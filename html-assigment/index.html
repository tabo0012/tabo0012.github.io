<p>
Currently, I learned English to be able to take the interactive media design program in algonquin college Canada. Nowadays, every day I say that every sacrifice is an opportunity. Sometimes I feel like watching the sunset and the sky, and I say: <em> I am very capable of doing anything that I only dream of being able to fly so high that only my last breath will make me fly.</em>
