My name is David Alejandro Taborda Castro, born in 7 <sup>th</sup> of September 1993 Bogotá Colombia, my doctrine is the Catholic Church, I am 30 years old, and I like sports. I am the 2  <sup>nd</sup> men in the house, is just my brother and me.  
I am a social communicator a photographer-journalist from <abbr title="Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano">UJTL</abbr>. I also have a diploma in governance, management, and public administration form universidad del Rosario.</p>

<p>
Currently, I learned English to be able to take the interactive media design program in algonquin college Canada. Nowadays, every day I say that every sacrifice is an opportunity. Sometimes I feel like watching the sunset and the sky, and I say: <em> I am very capable of doing anything that I only dream of being able to fly so high that only my last breath will make me fly.</em>
